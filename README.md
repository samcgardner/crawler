Somewhat awkwardly, I was doing this as a one-off playing with a REPL-driven development cycle and didn't write any tests. I could make some up, but it seems somewhat dishonest. You can check out https://github.com/samcgardner/fundapps-kata if you'd like an example of me following a more traditional test-based workflow.
